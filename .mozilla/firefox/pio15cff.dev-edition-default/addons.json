load and when you have numerous open tabs.","fullDescription":"\"Auto Tab Discard\" is a lightweight browser extension that automatically reduces the amount of memory used by open but inactive tabs, helping to conserve battery life on portable devices by disabling JavaScript code and DOM events on discarded tabs.\n\nPreview:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ityhxUPp3y8\n\nInstruction:\n\nThere are two options on the extension's interface to either discard tabs or release discarding (the \"x\" buttons)\n\n\nThe features of \"Auto Tab Discard\" are:\n\n* Improves browser performance and reduces memory usage by automatically or manually discarding inactive, idle, or forgotten tabs.\n* Includes a list of hostnames or regular expressions that can be excluded from auto-discarding.\n* Preserves the discarded state of tabs when the browser is closed and reopened.\n* Indicates the discarded state of a tab through the favicon or title.\n* Restores the state of a tab, including scroll position and text box content, after it is released from being discarded.\n* Allows for the forced discarding of specified hostnames.\n\n\nThe options for configuring whether tabs should be discarded or not include:\n\n* Pinned tabs\n* Tabs that are playing media\n* The presence of a power source\n* Unsaved content or user input in a tab\n\nThe available plugins for \"Auto Tab Discard\" are:\n\n* Release the discarded state of the next or previous tab.\n* Release the discarded state of all tabs in the active window.\n* Automatically discard all newly opened inactive tabs.\n* Store YouTube's timestamp before a tab is discarded.\n* Permanently delete (remove) old discarded tabs that are inactive.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Unlike the \"The Great Suspender\" extension, this extension uses the native method for discarding tabs, which means that even if the extension is removed or the browser crashes, your browser will automatically restore everything for you.\n\nPrivacy

Right-click the toolbar button for more options.\n\nNote: You must click the toolbar button; extensions cannot change the left-click behavior of tabs.\n\nKeyboard shortcut: Alt+Shift+Left Arrow switches to the immediately previous tab in the same window; on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+Left Arrow. Users of Firefox 66 and later can modify the shortcut through the Add-ons page: Manage extension shortcuts in Firefox.\n\nVersion 2.1 adds optional \"Go to Tab\" shortcuts. You already have Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. (on Mac, Command+1, Command+2). If you want keyboard shortcuts that can skip pinned, hidden, and unloaded tabs, you can set those up on the Add-ons page (refer to the above article for where to do that).\n\nReload All Tabs: \"Reload All Tabs\" on the tab context menu reloads all tabs that are not currently playing media. To force a full reload bypassing the cache, hold down the Shift key while clicking the menu command. (Fifth screenshot.)\n\nYou can set the extension to always bypass cache, to reload tabs with currently playing media, or to skip the active tab, pinned tabs, or pending/discarded tabs, on the Reload All Tabs Options tab. To call that up, either Ctrl+click \"Reload All Tabs\" or right-click the extension's toolbar button. (Sixth screenshot.)\n\nPermissions: \"Access browser tabs\" allows the extension to read the URLs, titles and site icon addresses of pages in tabs. Up to 30 URLs are kept in memory to build the list of recently accessed tabs. See: Permission request messages for Firefox extensions (scroll way down or use Find to get to Access browser tabs.\n\nBackground: Could be useful to those who miss this feature from the legacy extensions FLST (Firefox 4+) by fabianswebworld, LastTab by Timothy Humphrey, or Tab Mix Plus by onemen, Gary Reyes. However, to repeat: it's not possible to connect this extension to a click on the current tab.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/212/212367.png?modified=1677653076","width":340,"height":399,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212367.jpg?modified=1677653076","thumbnailWidth":340,"thumbnailHeight":399,"caption":"Toolbar button right-click context menu provides access to recent tabs list and options."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/244/244583.png?modified=1677653076","width":690,"height":470,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/244/244583.jpg?modified=1677653076","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":363,"caption":"Lists of recent tabs for the current window or all windows (global)."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/279/279278.png?modified=1677653082","width":700,"height":576,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/279/279278.jpg?modified=1677653082","thumbnailWidth":486,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Manage whether the buttons switches immediately or shows the list, and whether it operates within the same window or globally.
